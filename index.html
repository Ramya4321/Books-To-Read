						Wings of Fire: An Autobiography of A P J Abdul Kalam (1999), former President of India. 
						It was written by Dr. Abdul Kalam and Arun Tiwari.

						eventually led him to lead Indian space research, nuclear and missile programs. 
						Kalam started his career, after graduating from Aerospace engineering at MIT (Chennai), 
						India, at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and was assigned to build a hovercraft prototype. 
						Later he moved to ISRO and helped establish the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre and pioneered 
						the first space launch-vehicle program. During the 1990s and early 2000, Kalam moved to 
						the DRDO to lead the Indian nuclear weapons program, with particular successes in 
						thermonuclear weapons development culminating in the operation Smiling Buddha 
						and an ICBM Agni (missile). Kalam died on 27 July 2015, during a speech at Indian Institute of 
						Management in Shillong, Meghalaya.
